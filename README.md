## Automatic deployment on GitHub Pages

Demo at  
https://physikonline-ffm.github.io/tinyGU

via Travis CI the Project is automatically built and pushed to the gh-pages branch. The .travis.yml-config file is in the root directoy.

Not set up yet but generally possible would be an integration of greenkeeper.io which automatically updates the packages for the builds at travis.
